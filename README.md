##Approach
I started with a basic Angular app that I created by following along with the Code Scool "Shaping Up with Angluar" course. The opbject of this assignment was to integrate the app with Rails and serve it on Heroku. I started off by creating a new Rails app in the root folder of my app. I created a simple file structure under my app/assets/javascripts folder to house most of my Angular code. Images and HTML files for my directives were stored in the public folder. I had to create a simple controller and view page for my Angular app to load on. After getting some help from Tyler, my site was up and running. Lastly, I needed to update my gemfile so I could deploy to Heroku.
